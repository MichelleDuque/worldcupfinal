            <p class="lb_text">
                Three times, in 1930, 1990, and 2014, Argentina finished second. Argentina won 48 games in 84 matches throughout 18 World Cup competitions. The team appeared in all but four of the World Cups, placing third in terms of appearances only after Brazil and Germany (with the 2022 edition included, being played).
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Additionally, Argentina has shared the most Copa América victories (15) with Uruguay. Additionally, Argentina won the gold medal at the 2004 and 2008 Olympic football tournaments as well as the Confederations Cup.

                <p class="lb_text">
                    Brazil has won five titles and placed second, third, and fourth twice apiece, making them the most successful national team in World Cup history. Brazil joined Argentina, Spain, and Germany as nations that have won the FIFA World Cup outside of their home continents (Sweden in 1958, Chile in 1962, Mexico in 1970, the United States in 1994, and South Korea/Japan in 2002).
                </p>
                <p class="lb_text">
                    Brazil is the only national team to have participated in every FIFA World Cup without missing any games or having to go through a playoff process. Brazil won 74 out of 110 games in 22 World Cup competitions.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Four FIFA-sponsored World Football Championships have been won by Uruguay. Before that, only European teams played football at the Olympics. They also won the first FIFA World Championship, which was held under the auspices of the Olympic Committee. The following two World Cups, the 1930 and 1950 FIFA World Cups, in which Uruguay played, were completely independent from the Olympics and had distinct rules separating professional and amateur football players (Jules Rimet Trophy).
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                FIFA acknowledges Uruguay as a four-time world champion and permits the squad to wear four stars on their uniforms during legitimate international football games because 1924 marked the start of true international competition, which was governed by FIFA.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">PORTUGAL</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            You might be surprised to learn that Portugal wasn't always a football superpower, given their tremendous recent success. Portugal only made it into two of the 16 World Cups held throughout the 20th century. But things changed for the better in the middle of the 1990s with the arrival of the golden generation. 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
            The team kept getting better regularly after that, and their eventual triumph at Euro 2016 was the result of that process. Seven times, Portugal has reached the FIFA World Cup finals; the first time was in 1966, when they finished third.

        <p class="lb_text">
            Since 1950, the England national football team has participated in the FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious international football competition. It was first played in 1930, and since then, the finals have been held every four years, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 because of World War II.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Although England didn't join the contest until 1950, they have participated in all 18 tournaments since then. Three times, in 1974 (West Germany), 1978 (Argentina), and 1994 (United States), they were unable to go past the group stage. The other three times were in 1950, 1958, and 2014.

        <p class="lb_text">
            The nickname for France is Les Bleus. They won the most recent World Cup final in 2018, making them the current world champions. Didier Deschamps is the manager of France, who plays its home games at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Île-de-France. They have also won one CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions, one UEFA Nations League championship, two FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, 
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
            The 1980s, the late 1990s/early 2000s, and the late 2010s were the three main periods of France's success, which led to a number of significant awards. One of the four European teams who competed in the 1930 World Cup was France. The team, led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, came in third at the 1958 FIFA World Cup 28 years later.
